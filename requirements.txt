Headline (Hero Section):
=K Hi, I'm Corey  Software Developer & Creator

Subheadline:
From the open road to the digital world, I specialize in building web applications that make life easier, smarter, and more enjoyable.

About Me Section:
I'm a software developer with a strong focus on TypeScript, JavaScript, Next.js, React, and Node.js. I'm also deeply experienced in database querying, with expertise in MongoDB and Supabase.

While I currently work as a truck driver, my true passion lies in creating digital solutions  crafting websites and applications that help people solve problems, save time, and even have fun in the process.

Recently, I've been leveraging AI tools to build faster and smarter, accelerating the way I prototype, debug, and deliver projects. This has opened new possibilities in how I approach problem-solving and has sharpened my ability to create innovative solutions quickly.

Curiosity is at the heart of who I am. I love to learn continuously, experiment with new technologies, and push myself to grow as both a developer and a person.

Outside of coding, I've spent over a decade on the mats and earned the rank of black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu  a journey that taught me discipline, resilience, and the art of solving problems one step at a time.
